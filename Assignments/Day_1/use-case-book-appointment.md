**Steps:**

1. **Salesforce displays error message:**
   - "Error: An appointment already exists for Dr. Sarah on 2025-10-21 at 14:00. Please choose a different time."

2. **Receptionist acknowledges the error:**
   - "I'm sorry, Mrs. Johnson, it looks like that slot was just booked by another receptionist. Let me check other available times."

3. **Receptionist checks alternative times:**
   - Filter Appointments by date: 2025-10-21
   - Identify available slots: 10:00 AM, 3:00 PM, 4:30 PM

4. **Receptionist offers alternatives:**
   - "We have slots available at 10:00 AM, 3:00 PM, or 4:30 PM. Which would work best for you?"

5. **Patient chooses alternative:**
   - "I'll take the 3:00 PM slot."

6. **Receptionist creates appointment with new time:**
   - Update **Appointment Time:** 15:00 (3:00 PM)
   - Click **Save**
   - Appointment is successfully created

7. **Return to Step 9** (confirm appointment details with patient)

1. **Receptionist searches multiple times:**
   - Search by name: "Elizabeth Johnson" - no results
   - Search by phone number - no results

2. **Receptionist informs patient:**
   - "Mrs. Johnson, I don't see your record in our system. Are you a new patient, or have you been here before?"

3. **Patient responds:**
   - "I've been coming here for 10 years!"

4. **Receptionist realizes data migration issue:**
   - Patient record may not have been migrated from old paper system

5. **Receptionist creates new patient record:**
   - Navigate to **Contacts** tab
   - Click **New**
   - Fill in patient details:
     - First Name: Elizabeth
     - Last Name: Johnson

   - All slots on 2025-10-21 are fully booked

2. **Receptionist informs patient:**
   - "I'm sorry, Mrs. Johnson, we're fully booked on Tuesday. However, because you're a high-risk patient, let me check if we can fit you in."

3. **Receptionist escalates to senior receptionist or practice manager:**
   - "We have a high-risk patient (diabetic, elderly) requesting an appointment. Can we add an extra slot?"

4. **Manager approves emergency slot:**
   - "Yes, add her at 1:30 PM - we'll squeeze her in."

5. **Receptionist offers emergency slot:**
   - "Good news, Mrs. Johnson. We can fit you in at 1:30 PM on Tuesday."

6. **Patient accepts:**
   - "Thank you so much!"

7. **Return to Step 6** (create appointment with 1:30 PM time)

### **Alternative Flow 4: Patient Requests Unavailable Doctor**

   - Dr. Patel is on holiday that week

3. **Receptionist informs patient:**
   - "I'm sorry, Dr. Patel is on holiday that week. Dr. Sarah is available, or we can book you for the following week when Dr. Patel returns."

4. **Patient decides:**
   - Option A: "I'll see Dr. Sarah" ‚Üí Return to **Step 6**
   - Option B: "I'll wait for Dr. Patel" ‚Üí Receptionist checks next week's availability and returns to **Step 4**
